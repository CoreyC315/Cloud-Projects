# Cloud Engineering Labs üå©Ô∏è

This repository contains hands-on labs from my cloud computing coursework, focused on **Azure, Docker, Kubernetes, and PowerShell automation**. Each project highlights key cloud skills:  

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Deploying resources via ARM/Bicep (future goal: Terraform).  
- **Containerization**: Dockerized apps, Azure Container Apps, and Kubernetes.  
- **Networking**: Load balancers, Application Gateways, NSGs, and Bastion hosts.  
- **Automation**: PowerShell scripts for system administration.  

## Labs Overview  

| Lab | Key Skills | Relevance to Cloud Roles |  
|------|------------|--------------------------|  
| [Containers & Azure Functions](containers-azure-functions/) | Docker, Kubernetes, Azure Functions | Serverless computing, microservices |  
| [Azure Load Balancing](azure-load-balancing/) | Load Balancers, Application Gateway, Path-Based Routing | Scalability, high availability |  
| [Azure Bastion & VMs](azure-vm-bastion/) | Network Security Groups (NSGs), Subnet Design | Cloud security best practices |  
| [PowerShell Scripting](powershell-scripts/) | File management, Network diagnostics | Automation for cloud ops |  

## How to Use  
1. **For Recruiters**: Explore the `README.md` in each lab for goals, screenshots, and learnings.  
2. **For Engineers**: Clone the repo and adapt scripts for your Azure environment.  

## Future Enhancements  
- Migrate deployments to **Terraform**.  
- Add **CI/CD pipelines** (GitHub Actions/Azure DevOps).  
- Extend with **multi-cloud examples** (AWS/GCP).
